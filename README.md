## Context 

In Europe, bicycle stations are strategically located at various points, each equipped with a designated bike capacity. It is crucial to monitor these stations in real-time to promptly identify instances when a station becomes empty. Taking proactive measures is essential to ensure user satisfaction, as users seeking bicycles expect to find stations adequately stocked when they wish to utilize the service. This project aims to achieve real-time visualizations by retrieving data from the JCDecaux API and presenting it in a dynamic dashboard.

### JCDecaux API Documentation

To retrieve real-time data on bicycle stations, this project utilizes the JCDecaux API. You can find detailed information and documentation on the API by visiting the [JCDecaux API Documentation](https://developer.jcdecaux.com/).

**Note:** Before using the JCDecaux API, make sure to obtain your API key from JCDecaux. You can register for an API key on their [developer portal](https://developer.jcdecaux.com/).

The JCDecaux API allows you to access information about bike stations, available bikes, and more, enabling dynamic and up-to-date visualizations in the project's dashboard.


NOTE :  Make sure to get an api_key.
